 

2. add full editing (in memory) for height [and splat later] with re-saving ability . 


- allow for saving heightmap to image files (maybe with event?)
- allow for editing the splat map (in memory -- use handle )

- need to update all nearby chunks that brush touches 

 
  
  
  3. lods 
  
  Consider having only 1 LOD levels and retaining them both in memory to minimzie lag 
  
  
  
  
  ### BUGS 
  
  1. there is a weird graphic glitch on the terrain shader or normals ... depth buffer ??
