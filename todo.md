 

1. consider allowing for WAY WAY larger dimension map   - but only do calculations on chunks that are 'close' so dynamic computing of them EFFICIENTLY with separate small textures 

2. add full editing (in memory) for height [and splat later] with re-saving ability . 

 
  
  
  3. lods 
  
  Consider having only 1 LOD levels and retaining them both in memory to minimzie lag 
  
  
  
  
  ### BUGS 
  
  1. make sure chunks go invisible when far away
